# Drawing Tools Guide

Master TerraShaper Pro's drawing tools to create precise, professional landscape designs.

## Area Tool

The Area tool creates closed shapes for landscape features like beds, lawns, and hardscapes.

### Basic Usage
1. Select the Area tool (A) from the toolbar
2. Click to place points defining your shape
3. Click the first point or press Enter to close the shape

### Drawing Tips
- **Straight Lines**: Hold Shift while clicking
- **Curved Edges**: Click and drag to create bezier curves
- **Right Angles**: Hold Shift for 90Â° angles
- **Edit Points**: Double-click a shape to edit vertices

### Material Assignment
After drawing an area:
1. Select the shape
2. Choose material from the Properties panel:
   - Mulch types
   - Turf varieties  
   - Hardscape materials
   - Water features

### Advanced Features
- **Subtract Areas**: Create holes in shapes (e.g., trees in lawns)
- **Merge Areas**: Combine multiple shapes
- **Offset Tool**: Create borders at specific distances

## Line Tool

The Line tool creates paths, edges, and linear features.

### Drawing Lines
1. Select the Line tool (L)
2. Click to place points
3. Press Enter or Escape to finish

### Line Types
- **Bed Edging**: Steel, stone, plastic options
- **Paths**: Decomposed granite, flagstone, concrete
- **Borders**: Decorative edges and trim
- **Utilities**: Irrigation lines, lighting cables

### Line Properties
- **Width**: Adjust thickness
- **Style**: Solid, dashed, dotted
- **Color**: Match material colors
- **End Caps**: Round, square, or decorative

## Shape Tools

### Rectangle Tool
- Click and drag to create
- Hold Shift for squares
- Enter exact dimensions

### Circle Tool  
- Click and drag from center
- Hold Shift for perfect circles
- Specify radius numerically

### Polygon Tool
- Create regular polygons
- Set number of sides
- Useful for gazebos, fire pits

## Smart Drawing Features

### Snapping
Enable snapping for precision:
- **Grid Snap**: Align to grid points
- **Object Snap**: Connect to existing objects
- **Guide Snap**: Use alignment guides

### Alignment Guides
- Automatic guides appear when aligning objects
- Show distances between objects
- Indicate perpendicular and parallel relationships

### Dimension Lines
- Automatically show measurements
- Customize units and precision
- Export with or without dimensions

## Modifying Shapes

### Edit Mode
Double-click any shape to enter edit mode:
- **Move Points**: Drag vertices
- **Add Points**: Click on path
- **Delete Points**: Select and press Delete
- **Convert Points**: Change between corner and curve

### Transform Tools
- **Rotate**: Turn objects around center
- **Scale**: Resize proportionally
- **Mirror**: Flip horizontally/vertically
- **Array**: Create multiple copies

## Measurement Tools

### Distance Measurement
1. Select Measure tool (M)
2. Click start and end points
3. See distance in current units

### Area Calculation
1. Click points to define area
2. Close shape to see square footage
3. Useful for material estimates

### Perimeter Measurement
- Automatically calculated for all shapes
- Shown in Properties panel
- Used for edging estimates

## Advanced Techniques

### Bezier Curves
Master smooth curves:
1. Click and drag to create curve points
2. Adjust handles for curve shape
3. Convert between curve types

### Path Operations
- **Union**: Combine shapes
- **Subtract**: Remove overlapping areas
- **Intersect**: Keep only overlaps
- **Divide**: Split shapes

### Precision Input
Enter exact measurements:
1. Start drawing a shape
2. Type dimension (e.g., "10'6"")
3. Press Tab to move to next dimension

## Best Practices

### Organization
- Name all shapes descriptively
- Use layers to organize elements
- Group related objects
- Color-code by material type

### Accuracy
- Set appropriate grid size
- Use snapping for connections
- Verify measurements regularly
- Check scale before exporting

### Efficiency Tips
- Learn keyboard shortcuts
- Create templates for common shapes
- Use copy/paste for repetitive elements
- Save custom shapes to library

## Troubleshooting

### Shapes Won't Close
- Ensure first and last points overlap
- Check for duplicate points
- Zoom in for precision

### Inaccurate Measurements
- Verify scale settings
- Check unit preferences
- Calibrate using known distances

### Performance Issues
- Simplify complex shapes
- Reduce number of points
- Merge similar materials
- Use layers effectively
